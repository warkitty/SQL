I'm trying to learn and develop my skills. This is a work in progress

This was my final delivery @Hult. 

Discription: 
The video streaming platform has a worldwide user base which can access a variety of movies and series. The available content includes movies and series from all genres and is frequently updated. Next to third party distributors, self-produced (Netflix) content is offered.

\n Before watching, users must sign up to the platform. They can choose from different monthly payment plans to get access to the content. A user can cancel their subscription monthly. Furthermore, the user's payment is dependent on their subscription. A kid’s mode can be set on the profile at the “family” profile. Kid´s mode will restrict the visibility of movies and series according to the official maturity rating. 
The video streaming platform requests that the new database is easily giving answers to the following business questions:
\n•	Most popular movie distributor to negotiate a deal for more content to stream on the platform.
\n•	Most popular genres for all segments (adults/kids – series/movies) to concisely expand offer.
\n•	Least popular movies / series in the last year in order to remove the content and reduce associated costs like licensing right feels.
\n•	Revenue created from the prescription model by the active users in the last year for reporting purposes. 
\n•	Most popular genres and average playtime for churning customers to identify potential reasons of leaving and potential reactions to win back the customers.
\n•	Identify the distribution of customers among countries to customize content to specific cultures to see their preferences.
\n•	Popularity of self-produced movies and series.
\n To answer these business questions, user data must relate to the movie and series data. It is important to record the time and frequency a user watches content to identify the popularity of different movies, series, or genres. Furthermore, confidential information such as personal or payment related information should be stored separately to ensure data security. This enables a correct allocation of stream time to the different points of analysis.
